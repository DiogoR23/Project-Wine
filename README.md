# Project-Wine
In this Project, I created 2 types of models (Supervised Learning and Unsupervised learning), in each model I used 2 Diferent Datasets but with the same information (White Wine and Red Wine). 

First, I started this project with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), this helps me to understand the characteristics of the DataSets, by identifying patterns, and make informed decisions about the next steps in my analysis.

Secondly, In Supervised Learning, I used Linear Regression to predict quality´s variable using the features from the dataset that could influence the wine´s quality. For evaluating this model I used Mean Squared Error (MSE), a metric wich gave me the error of the model.

Finally, In Unsupervised Learning, I used Clustering to group or to cluster the data based on inheret patterns, possibly uncovering natural groupings or similarities within the dataset. For evaluating this modek I used Silhouette Score and Elbow Method, 2 metrics wich helped me to reach the number of the cluster I should give into the model.
