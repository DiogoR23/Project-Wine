# Project-Wine
In this project, I created two types of models (Supervised Learning and Unsupervised Learning), using two different datasets with the same information (White Wine and Red Wine).

Firstly, I initiated the project with Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This step helped me understand the characteristics of the datasets by identifying patterns and making informed decisions about the next steps in my analysis.

Secondly, in Supervised Learning, I employed Linear Regression to predict the 'quality' variable using features from the dataset that could influence wine quality. To evaluate this model, I used Mean Squared Error (MSE), a metric that provided me with the model's error.

Finally, in Unsupervised Learning, I applied Clustering to group or cluster the data based on inherent patterns, possibly uncovering natural groupings or similarities within the dataset. To evaluate this model, I used Silhouette Score and the Elbow Method, two metrics that helped me determine the optimal number of clusters for the model.
